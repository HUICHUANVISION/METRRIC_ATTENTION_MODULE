# METRRIC_ATTENTION_MODULE
# Metric Attention Module (MAM) for Software Defect Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of the **Metric Attention Module (MAM)** for enhancing software defect prediction models via interpretable attention-based feature enhancement. The model captures intra-instance, inter-instance, intra-metric, and cross-metric relationships, improving traditional classifiers on benchmark datasets such as NASA CM1.

ðŸ§  Model Details

The Metric Attention Module (MAM) computes four types of relational features:
	â€¢	Corr1: Inter-metric feature relationships within instance
	â€¢	Corr2: Inter-instance feature relationships
	â€¢	Corr3: Correlation within metric features
	â€¢	Corr4: Correlation between single metric features

Each branch uses a scaled dot-product attention mechanism with learnable weights. Outputs are fused with coefficients (Î±, Î², Î³, Î´) and applied to raw features for enhanced representations.
